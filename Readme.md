dotfiles
========

My dotfiles, here on GitHub so that I don't loose them. You are welcome to use
and/or improve them.

My dotfiles are mostly inspired by the following projects/people and their dotfiles:
- [YADR](http://skwp.github.com/dotfiles/)
- [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
- [Steve Losh-Coming Home to Vim](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/09/coming-home-to-vim/)
- [Steve Losh-My Extravagant Zsh Prompt](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/02/my-extravagant-zsh-prompt/)
